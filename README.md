Working in  progress to reproduce [DSOD: Learning Deeply Supervised Object Detectors from Scratch](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Shen_DSOD_Learning_Deeply_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)

Original Implementation in Caffe could be found from [here](https://github.com/szq0214/DSOD)

This implementation is based on [torchcv](https://github.com/kuangliu/torchcv):a PyTorch vision library mimics ChainerCV


see train code at `examples/dsod/train.py`

see model at `torchcv/models/dsod/'
